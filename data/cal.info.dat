#   Tref.ASPH       is the temperature of pure water used by Hobilabs for the ASPH calibration
#                   (in 2010 and 2014 it was 13.2, in 2013 it was 19)
#   Tref.ACS        is the temperature of pure water used by Wetlabs for the ACS calibration
#   scat.correction is the method for the scattering correction of ACS abssorption
#                   (eg : "mckee","zaneveld", "baseline","none")
#   HS6.CALYEAR     is the year of the HS6 calibration
#   blank.ASPH      is a string for the path of the blank for ASPH
#   blank.ACS       is a string for the path of the blank for ACS
#   blank.BB9       is a string for the path of the blank for BB9 (if a *.dev is provided, than the BB9 raw data will be converted in calibrated data using the calibration)
#   blank.BB3       is a string for the path of the blank for BB3 (if a *.dev is provided, than the BB3 raw data will be converted in calibrated data using the calibration)

#  NOTE: any field can be ommited with out problem
