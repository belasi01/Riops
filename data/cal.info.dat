#   Tref.ASPH       is the temperature of pure water used by Hobilabs for the ASPH calibration
#                   (in 2010 and 2014 it was 13.2, in 2013 it was 19)
#   Tref.ACS        is the temperature of pure water used by Wetlabs for the ACS calibration
#   scat.correction is the method for the scattering correction of ACS abssorption
#                   (eg : "mckee","zaneveld", "baseline","none")
#   ASPH.biascor    is the TRUE/FALSE needed to correct the underestimation bias of ASPH
#   HS6.CALYEAR     is the year of the HS6 calibration
#   blank.ASPH      is a string for the path of the blank for ASPH
